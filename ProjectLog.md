Project Log for Gumption Fables
==============

Initial commit - I have officially started the project by adding a commit to the Github, there is no content yet. At this point, I am looking at doing a point and click adventure game. In light of me starting this major project, I have prepared a haiku:

I have included my puzzle notes and added a MainProgram.py to the Github. The puzzle notes are a set of events that trigger other events in the game. So in effect it is a storyboard for the gameplay. I have chapter 1 and chapter 2 done, and implemented into a flowchart on GoogleDrive. When I finish writing the first three chapters, I will turn it into a pdf and share it on the Github. The initial version of the game will only consist of the first three chapters of gameplay, and I will continue adding more chapters as I go.

In this commit I have added a scan of my initial storyboard - the storyboard shows gameplay and menus. This shows every possible situation in the software I have currently planned. In this commit, I also deleted gitignore.txt. I have now included ProjectLog.md in the Github files.

I have created a context diagram in which it outlines what data is passed in and out of the system.
