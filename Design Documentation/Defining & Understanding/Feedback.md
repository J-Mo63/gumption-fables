*1) I do not have the funds available to pay for voice-acting for each character.
*2) At this point, there will be no online connectivity, and multiplayer would not make sense with the mechanics of the game.
*3) As the game is based on the 'Gumption Fables' series, I would not be inclined to meddle with the lore for the original authors sake.
*4) I dont believe I will be able to obtain Garry Neumann's IP, 'Garry's Mod' from Facepunch Studios.
*5) Similar to the online multiplayer, the project is not looking to have network connectivity.
*6) The nature of a point & click game does not involve 'boss' mechanics, and while the puzzles will get harder as the game progresses, there will be no ultimate character that you must fight - although, this is subject to change.
