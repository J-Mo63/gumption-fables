*Development Approach*

I suggest on using a hybrid of the structured and agile approaches fro this specific project, possibly because it is the most fitting for a game.
The mechanics of the game will be done using the structured approach as I will know all of my requirements when I have finished my planning and design. On the other hand, there is a huge amount of content involved in the game, and as such, I will be implementing stages as the games development progresses. This combination will allow me to pass the requirements of the course, while at the same time, permit me to extend or contract the length of the game based on development cycles possible within the project timeframe.
The structured approach is best for this project, as it involves providing initial documentation with an outline of the final product, as well as has to plan for a deadline to the project, ensuring that it stays on schedule. The reason why I added agile to the approach is only to allow extra content to be added to the final project after completion of the main mechanics. 
The structured approach consists of five defined stages:
    - Defining & Understanding
    - Planning & Design
    - Implementation
    - Testing & Evaluation
    - Maintainance
I will be progressing from stages one to four, but according to the assessment, I will not be working on on maintainance. So, in the next stages of the project, I will be planning the game, and I will work methodically through it to testing making sure that I have a functional point and click engine. This is where the agile method comes into play, where it is repeated a number of times, adding new content - in this case, more chapters and features like voice acting. The structured approach is good for knowing exactly how long a project will take, while agile gives me the freedom to add more content, time permitting.
