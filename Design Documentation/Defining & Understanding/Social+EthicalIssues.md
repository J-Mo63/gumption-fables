*Social & Ethical Issues*

Being a game, there are many social and ethical issues to consider when creating the project. The following summarises them in point-form:

- Intellectual Property

Intellectual property is the creators original idea and all of the creators original ideas belong to him and cannot be infringed on by any other people, and therefore I will have to take this into account when using tools and resources in my project. Firstly I must must pay respect to the original creator of any used software or resources, while also obeying the license agreement that it has/usage laws.
I should also have a software license agreement, where I state my rights and responsibilities as the creator of the software - making sure that the user is aware of this prior to their use of my product.

Licensing of the various programs and modules that I will be incorporating into to projects development, such as Brackets, Kivy and the assets I will be using. I should also state the license terms explicitly and avoid threatening terms, such as 'we reserve the right to eat your guts'. This includes making my game Garry's Mod or Call of Duty, as I do not own the appropriate IPs.



- Ergonomics

To prevent repetitive stress injuries, I may have to limit play session times to one click per play. Alternatively, I could add a cool-down to clicking, possibly neutralising the possible RSI. Should also implore that the user practise proper posture habits, similar to the warnings displayed on the start of Nintendo consoles - this can be in the form of . Eyestrain is also a prevalent issue, so making menu options large and easily seen is necessary. I must make UI consistent so to make sure that the user can easily understand and less effort will be wasted on training. This includes legible and readable text. Just to make sure the software is user friendly, I will also make sure to add loading symbols to indicate a process is taking place.



- Inclusivity

To factor in inclusivity, I must make all content user-base sensitive, considering disabilities and backgrounds. Examples include using a contrasting colour palette, or not using racial slurs as menu options. The user request of 'sexy mode' may have to be omitted due to its controversial premise. I need to cater audiences by being culturally sensitive, economically sensitive, socially sensitive and gender sensitive. By making the game pay what you want, I will avoid excluding users by economic means. For a while I considered freemium, although I was too busy being exploited by EA to think for myself. I can also translate the game, time permitting so to cater to different social and cultural backgrounds. I need to take into account both genders when designing software to accommodate various thinking styles, such as preventing gender inequality, not only sexualised women, but also sexualising men in my game. This is an example being conscious of the social issues related to the portal of gender that may exclude a group of users. I will also need to cater to the vision impaired, by using high contract colour schemes to combat colour blindness as an issue in using my software.
